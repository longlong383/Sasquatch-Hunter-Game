# Sasquatch-Hunter-Game
This was developped in Android Studio in Javascript as an Android Application for practice on coding concepts including encapsulation, and utilizes multiple functions.
The game is like a multi-choice game, where users must choose an attack option, then hope they are not defeated by the 3 sasquatches who are the enemy.
Due to some difficulties, the widget designs and such will be put into a zip file, with the main program put in the repo for viewing.
